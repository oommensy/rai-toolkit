## 📝 Template Best Practices

### ✅ Do's
- Fill out templates completely before deployment
- Keep documentation up-to-date with model changes
- Use examples as starting points, not final versions
- Store completed documents in version control
- Share with relevant stakeholders for review

### ❌ Don'ts
- Skip sections thinking they don't apply
- Copy examples without customization
- Forget to update dates and versions
- Keep documentation private from audit teams
- Use templates for multiple projects without updates

## 🔄 Template Lifecycle

```
Project Start → Risk Register → Data/Model Cards → DPIA (if needed) → Regular Updates
```
